# Zed GDScript

This extension adds support for the [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html) language.

## Language Server Protocol

Support for the Godot Language Server Protocol (LSP) is provided via `nc` which is assumed to be in your `PATH`.

The language server is expected to be running on the default ip `127.0.0.1` and port `6005`.
